                        <p>Talent rates are dependent on talent chosen, product, length/region of buy out. All rates negotiated on a per job basis. Sao Paulo has the largest Japanese community outside Japan, over 1 million, in addition to Chinese and Taiwanese. The population of Brazil is made up in large part of German, Italian, Polish, Portuguese in the south, in addition to French, Swedish, Dutch, Arab, and primarily African and Amazon Indian in the north. Rio and Sao Paulo are the centre of this melting pot. A large pool of talent is available between these two cities.</p>
                        <p>Children under 18 are subject to judicial authorization which requires approximately 3 days (to keep in mind when casting). Casting is posted to FTP for client viewing at the end of casting day.</p>

                        <p>We maintain relationships with hotels to secure best rates for clients. Please send us an e-mail for hotel list. Brazil does not currently use carnet.

                        <p>Equipment and other items brought to Brazil for filming require you to sign a production agreement with a Brazilian production company registered with Ancine. Utopia Films is fully registered and can provide the required Ancine documentation within 1 to 5 days.</p>
                        <p>Photo equipment and visas for photo shoots in Brazil do not require Ancine authorization, however photo equipment may require a customs broker to clear when entering as accompanied baggage.</p>

                        <p>Safety is a legitimate concern when traveling clients, talent and crew to foreign countries. Brazilians in general are extremely friendly and approachable, in fact Rio de Janeiro was voted the most friendly city in the world by a major American magazine. In Rio the south zone areas of Copacabana, Ipanema, and Leblon are where the major hotels and famous beaches are located. There are plenty of shopping malls, restaurants and cinemas. Like any large city, Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro have areas that should be avoided and Utopia Films provides drivers, chaperones and security from the moment of arrival until departure of all foreign crew. Security personnel are on set during shoot days. Taxis are plentiful and safe. Metro runs between Copacabana and downtown and is modern, clean and safe. Use common sense, don't wear expensive jewelry to the beach or while walking in the street. Bring T shirts, shorts and sandals, and plenty of sunscreen. Dress like a local, feel like a local. Enjoy and relax.</p>

                        <p>Cell phones from around the world will work in Brazil if they are dual or tri-band phones. Check with your service provider. Cell phones can be provided locally, as well as option of purchasing or renting a local sim card.</p>
